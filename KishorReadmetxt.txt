This repo contains the customized workflow for microsong D365 using easyrepro. 

For this, I've downloaded easyrepro from github https://github.com/microsoft/EasyRepro and customized the test cases as per my need. 

The customized testacasd can be found \EasyRepro\Microsoft.Dynamics365.UIAutomation.Sample\Test_POC\, all the updates for the customized code can be found in this folder



I've created \EasyRepro\Microsoft.Dynamics365.UIAutomation.Sample\Test_POC\DYJFlow.cs. For this, I've created a new project using powerapps and after that I've automated the flow.
